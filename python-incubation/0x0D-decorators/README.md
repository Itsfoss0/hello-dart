## Introduction to decorators
__Decorators__ in Python are a powerful feature that allow you to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or classes without directly modifying their source code. They are represented by the `@decorator` syntax and provide a clean and concise way to extend the functionality of existing functions or classes.

## Decorator use cases
Decorators can be used for can be applied in alot of situations including
1. __Logging__: To log function calls, execution time, or other relevant information. This can be useful for debugging and performance monitoring.

2. __Authentication and Authorization__: To enforce authentication and authorization checks on functions or routes. They can verify user credentials or roles before allowing access to protected resources.

3. __Caching__: To  cache the results of expensive function calls to improve performance. They can store the results in memory or a persistent storage to avoid recomputation when the same inputs are encountered again.

4. __Validation__: Decorators can validate function arguments or return values, ensuring they meet specific criteria or constraints. They can be used for input validation, type checking, or data integrity checks.

5. __Rate Limiting__: To can restrict the number of times a function can be called within a given time period. This can be useful for preventing abuse or managing resources in APIs or web applications.

6. __Error Handling__: Decorators can handle exceptions raised within functions, providing a centralized way to handle specific types of errors. They can log the exceptions, transform them, or handle them gracefully.

7. __Method Wrapping__: Decorators can wrap class methods to add additional behavior, such as logging, timing, or pre-/post-processing steps. They can intercept method calls and modify their behavior without changing the original class code.

And many more.
